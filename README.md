This repository will go through an example of pitch clustering using pitch data collected from Rapsodo. 

The initial dataset, Pitch_Clustering_Practice.csv, details pitch information collected for a starting pitcher at the University of Rochester over the course of a game. 

The Pitch_Clustering_Example.Rmd file contains the code run through Rmarkdown for analysis.

The Pitch_Clustering_Example.pdf file is a pdf file displaying not only the code, but also clustering visuals as well. 

The Pitch_Clustering_Final_Data.csv file contains the final dataset. This file displays an extra column showing the type of pitch after kmeans clustering was performed.

The Pitch_CLustering_Visuals.pdf file displays visuals generated in Tableau
